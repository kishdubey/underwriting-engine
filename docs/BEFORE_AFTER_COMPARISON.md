Subject: Need 10 Year Cash Flow - 120 Valleywood

Hi team,

Can someone on your team please assist putting together a 10 year 
cash flow for this single tenant industrial asset attached?
 
Rent roll attached ‚Äì in place rent net rent is $14.21. Lease escalates 
3% annually until Feb 29 2032. Upon lease expiry please use an 85% 
renewal probability, tenant renewing at $17.50 net with 3.5% annual 
escalations. In 15% probability they do not renew, assume 8 months 
downtime, $5 TI, standard broker leasing commissions (8% net income 
year 1, 3.5% net income thereafter on a 5 year deal).
 
Let me know if any questions. If we can get before end of week that 
would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you,
Max

Hi Max, 

Please see attached with the following tabs:
 
* Valuation summary
* Cash Flow (I added a row below NOI that calculated yield on $17.8M PP), 
  so you can see cap rate by year
* Rent Schedule ‚Äì in term and rollover to MLA as per below
* Market Leasing Summary ‚Äì as per email below. Note I did not increase 
  the $17.50 PSF by any further market inflation, meaning in 2032 the 
  renewal rent is actually $17.50 + 3% annual increases thereafter.
