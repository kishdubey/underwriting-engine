# Bug Fix Summary - Cash Flow Start Date Issue

## ✅ Status: FIXED and VERIFIED

---

## The Bug

**Problem:** Cash flow projections started with the original lease rent instead of the current rent after escalations.

**Example:**
- Lease started: 1/1/2023 at $1,000,000/year
- Cash flow starts: 1/1/2026 (3 years later)
- Bug showed: $1,000,000 ❌
- Should show: $1,076,891 (after 3 years of 2.5% escalations) ✓

**Impact:**
- Incorrect yield calculations (understated by 50-70 bps)
- Wrong lease expiry year in cash flow
- Vacancy/TI costs applied in wrong year

## The Fix

**File:** [backend/cre_underwriter.py](backend/cre_underwriter.py)
**Lines:** 170-214

**What Was Added:**

```python
# Calculate current rent based on years since lease start
lease_start_date = datetime.strptime(lease_data['lease_start'], '%m/%d/%Y')
cf_start_date = datetime(2026, 1, 1)
years_elapsed = (cf_start_date - lease_start_date).days / 365.25

# Apply escalations for years already passed
current_rent = base_rent * ((1 + escalation_rate) ** int(years_elapsed))

# Calculate which year of cash flow the lease expires
lease_end_date = datetime.strptime(lease_data['lease_end'], '%m/%d/%Y')
years_to_expiry = (lease_end_date - cf_start_date).days / 365.25
expiry_year = int(years_to_expiry) + 1
```

✅ Starting rent uses current rent (not base)
✅ Rent escalations correct
✅ Lease expires in correct year
✅ Vacancy calculation correct
